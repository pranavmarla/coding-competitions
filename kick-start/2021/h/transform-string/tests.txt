Shortest distance:

A -> B: 1
A -> C: 2
B -> C: 1
B -> Y: 3
A -> Z: 1

#######

If we consider only 5 letters (A to E):
Total of 5 distances (A -> B, B -> C, etc.) = circle circumference
For any pair of letters, 2nd distance is circle circumference (5) - 1st distance
Eg. For circle with cirucmerece = 5:
A -> B:
    Distance 1 = 1
    Distance 2 = 5 - 1 = 4
